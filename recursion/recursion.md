# Recursion

## Learning objectives
- Understand recursion and Divide and Conquer technique.

### Estimated time: 1.5h

## Description

Recursion is one of the most confusing concepts in computer science. In general, recursion is the process of repeating items in a self-similar way.
In the case of programming languages, it is a process in which a function calls itself. 

### Why is it important?

Using recursion can help you to solve problems more easily. There are a few widely known algorithms that depend on recursion.

### Learn about recursion

- Let's start by reading a [Khan Academy definition of recursion](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/recursive-algorithms/a/recursion) that includes a nice parallel.
- Then watch the video about [recursion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oDQaB2one8) from Web Dev Simplified.
- Then learn about the [Divide and Conquer technique](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/divide-and-conquer).
- Check the [5 simple steps for solving any recursive problem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngCos392W4w) video.
- And follow a few examples of recursive functions in JavaScript in the article [A quick intro to recursion in JavaScript](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/quick-intro-to-recursion/) by Yazeed Bzadough.
